# Two-Level-Multiplier

This repository contains the source code for a VHDL implementation of the multiplication algorithm using a two-level hardware structure proposed in the paper "Leveraging a Novel Two-Level Priority Encoder for High-Precision Integer Multiplication." It contains several prefabricated sizes of square multipliers, as well as a C++ program to generate most components of new multipliers. The exception is carry-look-ahead adders, which can be easily manually created by modifying the existing files.
